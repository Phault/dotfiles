# NOTICE: From Parsec 150-89, the advanced configuration has moved to config.json
# The config.json file located in the same folder as config.txt.
# You can still add configuration to this file (config.txt) for backwards compatibility.
# When you save this file (config.txt) and restart the app, configuration will be migrated to config.json.
# This file (config.txt) will be cleared once the setting(s) have been saved and migrated.
# All configuration settings must appear on a new line.
# All whitespace, besides the newline character '\n', is ignored.
# See https://parsec.app/config for more information.

# Example:
# encoder_bitrate = 10
